Thank you for your interest in Stratroster! 

*Stratroster* is a simple, nuts-and-bolts approach to tracking rosters in fantasy baseball leagues -- specifically Strat-o-Matic super advanced baseball board game leagues. My goal in making this application was to make it as easy as possible to use for anyone in a pen-and-paper Strat-O-Matic baseball league. 

Stratroster is a PHP webapp using a sqlite3 database on the backend which allows for trades by an admin user between teams including draft picks for the next two drafts (rounds 1-10)

All modules in this release are released under the GPL as open source. Stratroster was written with the assistance of ChatGPT (MS Copilot) and it shows. 


*INSTALLATION:*
1) Place in your webroot (eg /var/www/stratroster)
2) Login as the default admin user (admin/stratroster)
3) Navigate to the admin page from the menu and name your league, and start adding users and teams and then assigning those new users to the new teams. 
4) have the new users update their rosters themselves via their add/edit players page or use that page to upload a CSV of their roster. 

This application was developed 100% for personal league use and so keep that in mind. May all of your rolls be on your hitters' cards...
